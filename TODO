==SETUP PART AND FOR LOCAL USE ADAPTATION

db creator at the first start of the backend, and local storage to remember
-> it has to test if table are missing before create new

create first data like first account (super admin to admin other account from it)
|-> if when a user is created, an email is send to his adress to confirm, then we have to make account
a function to create a user without sending him an email (cause it's the super admin) -> id of super admin : 1

make a complete doc to explain how to config the backend before pushing it up
to the server (config the ip adresse of the db server)

adapte the backend not to depend on idSchool, cause it is now local

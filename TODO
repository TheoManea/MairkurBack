==SETUP PART AND FOR LOCAL USE ADAPTATION

db creator at the first start of the backend, and local storage to remember
-> it has to test if table are missing before create new

create first data like first account (super admin to admin other account from it)
|-> if when a user is created, an email is send to his adress to confirm, then we have to make account
a function to create a user without sending him an email (cause it's the super admin) -> id of super admin : 1

make a complete doc to explain how to config the backend before pushing it up
to the server (config the ip adresse of the db server)


safe delete for Assos and Users -> no foreign keys/contraintes

bug, what if a parameter un the request body is empty -> crash
same if dates are invalide

==
images are supported yet in events management ... :/



JULIEN's discuss :
lvl 2 are able to create account, with just the email, (name, family name). Then Node JS will
send a email to the trouducu. --> do a smtp server ...

lvl 2 are able to delete, edit lvl 1 or 2 accounts (lvl access, idAssos)
But nobody can edit perso info exept the one who own the account
